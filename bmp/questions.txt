0.  BMP supports up to 4,294,967,296 distinct colours at 32bpp.
    JPEG supports up to 16 million distinct colours at 24bpp.
    PNG supports up to 281,474,976,710,656 distinct colours at 48bpp.
    GIF supports up to 256 distinct colours at 8bpp.
    
1.  Only GIF supports animation.

2.  Lossy, or irreversable compression uses inexact approximations and partial data discarding,
    which results in data being lost after compression, allowing for a smaller file size. 
    Lossless, or reversable compression on the other hand, maintains all original data, losing none.
    
3.  only JPEG files are lossy compressed.

4.  When a file is deleted on a FAT system, first, the system changes the filenames first character
    to signify the file has been deleted and can be recycled, and then the system moves all the 
    files FAT clusters to the harddrives list of free clusters.
    
5.  To ensure files cannot be recovered, one can degauss the harddrive, destroy the harddrive,  
    or overwrite all memory in the harddrive with random information, or all NULL zeroes.
    
6.  stdint.h is a header file which provides a set of typedefs which specify exact-width variables, 
    together with the defined minimum and maximum allowable values for each type,
    allowing for increased portability across different systems.
    
7.  The point of using uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t in a program is so that no matter 
    what system the code runs on, it gives you an integer of a predefined size. uint8_t is an
    unsigned 8 bit integer, uint32_t is an unsigned 32 bit integer, int32_t is a signed 32 bit integer,
    and uint16_t is an unsigned 16 bit integer.
    
8.  BYTE is 1 byte
    DWORD is 4 bytes,
    LONG is 4 bytes,
    WORD is 2 bytes
    
9.  the first two bytes in a BMP file are BM in ASCII, or 0x42 0x4D in HEX.

10. biSize is the number of bytes required by the structure, while bfSize is the size
    in bytes of the bitmap file.
    
11. if biHeight is negative, it indicated a top-down DIB with its origin in the upper left corner.
    
12. biBitCount specifies the bpp, or bits-per-pixel.

13. fopen may return NULL if it cant find the file, or runs out of memory.

14. the third argument of fread is always 1 because we are only reading one element at a time.

15. 3

16. fseek sets the position indicator to a new position, offsets the position of the stream by 3 bytes.

17. seek_CUR means the offset is based from the current position of the stream.

18. It's Rick Astley.
